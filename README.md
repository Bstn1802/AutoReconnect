# AutoReconnect

###It's a fork of auto-reconnect mod.

### Description

This mod allows you to afk without fear of getting disconnected. It will make 4 attempts to reconnect you to the server you were disconnected from, with a delay of 3, 10, 60 and 300 seconds.
After 4 failed attempts it will no longer try to reconnect.

<sub>(Btw you can exit the disconnect screen with <kbd>Esc</kbd>)</sub>
